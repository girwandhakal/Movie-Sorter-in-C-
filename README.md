# Movie Sorter: Organize Movie Data by Title and Year

This project is a C++ program that reads a list of movies from a text file, dynamically creates movie objects, and sorts them by both title and year. The sorted lists are saved into separate output files.

## Features

- Reads movie data from a file, including the movie title, year, and actors.
- Sorts movies by:
  - **Title** (alphabetically)
  - **Year**
- Saves the sorted lists into two separate text files: one sorted by title and another sorted by year.
- Efficiently manages memory by dynamically allocating and deallocating objects.
